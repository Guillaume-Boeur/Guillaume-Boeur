I am currently at the end of a **Web Developer** training at BeCode, in Li√®ge, Belgium and I am looking for an **internship** to gain more skills and a first professional experience as a developer.

Qualified in **graphic design**, I am now following a career path towards **Front-end development**.

Our training had a **full-stack approach** of the web development, with projects going from **design to development**. Thereby, my interest is the web development as a whole.
